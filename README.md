# cGAN (conditional generative and adversarial network)
Discentralized and Privacy-preserving Stain Normalization with Deep Learning in Biomedical Imaging. 

Worked on a novel distributed conditional generative and adversarial network (cGAN) to preserve the data-privacy in normalizing the histologies from multiple data centers. 

The related datasets are protected and not uploaded.

pix2pix.py is the model file.

py3_tf1.yaml is the enviornmnet file.

draw.py is to draw a graph.
